## [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro)

When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. However, currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or impossible for some people to use.

Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. International web standards define what is needed for accessibility.

> The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.

## Fully Accessible ♿️
Everything works out of the box, with documentation to make sure it is used right.
